        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 medium-sized yams</li>
            <li>6-8 fresh garden eggs</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>2-3 fresh tomatoes</li>
            <li>2-3 Scotch bonnet peppers (adjust to your spice preference)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of palm oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of ground crayfish</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash and peel the yams, then cut them into small chunks.</li>
            <li>Boil the yam chunks in a pot of water until they are tender. Drain and set aside.</li>

            <li>In a separate pot, boil the garden eggs until they are soft and tender, which should take about 20-30 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the garden eggs are boiling, prepare the sauce. In a blender, combine the chopped onions, tomatoes, Scotch bonnet peppers, and blend until smooth.</li>
            <li>In a separate pot, heat the palm oil and fry the blended sauce until the oil starts to separate from the mixture.</li>

            <li>Add the ground crayfish, salt, and pepper to taste. Continue to simmer for a few more minutes.</li>
